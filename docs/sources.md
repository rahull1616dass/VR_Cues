   CUE TYPES:

![1652639853585.png](img/1652639853585.png)

originally defined three purposes for interaction cues based on their ludography: discover, look, and go.

**Discover cues (travel)**: inform the user of objects or points of interest in the environment.

**Look cues**: inform the user where to put their visual attention.

**Go cues**: provide navigational assistance

Four additional purposes for interaction cues: pick, manipulate, gesture, and speak.

**Pick cues (selection)**: inform the user to select a particular object or element.

**Manipulate cues (manipulation)**: inform the user to move an object to a new position.

**Gesture cues:** inform the user to perform specific movements with their body.

**Speak cues**: inform the user to verbally communicate.

**There are main two plugin to that we can use to develop the video streaming (Display player view on supervisor)**


[1. Plugin 1(Unity official plugin)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.renderstreaming@2.0/manual/index.html)

[2. Plugin 2(Thrid party paid plugin)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/packs/fmetp-stream-v2-202537#description)


My opinion would be to use the Unity's official plugin but if ViA VR already using some other plugin it would be better if we use that.
